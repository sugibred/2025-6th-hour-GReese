#1. Create a for loop with variable i that counts down from 5 to 1 and then prints "Hello World!"
#at the end.
for i in range(5,0,-1):
    print(i)
else:
    print('hello world')
#2. Create a for loop that counts up and prints only even numbers between 1 and 30.
for j in range(2,31,2):
    print(j)
#3. Create a for loop that prints from 1 to 30 and continues (skips the number) if the number is
#divisible by 3.
for k in range(1,30):
    if k % 3 == 0:
        continue
    print(k)
#4. Create a for loop that prints 5 different animals from a list.
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'elephant', 'rabbit', 'monkey']
for l in animals:
    print(l)
#5. Create a for loop that spells out a word you input backwards.
#(HINT: Google "How to reverse a string in Python")
reverse=''
for m in input('give me a word:')[::-1]:
    print (m)

#6. Create a list containing 10 integers of your choice and print the list.
listy= [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
print(listy)
#7. Create two empty variables named evenNumbers and oddNumbers.
evenNumbers=0
oddNumbers=0
#8. Make a loop that counts the number of even and odd numbers in the list, and prints the
#result after the loop.
for n in listy:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        evenNumbers += 1
    else:
        oddNumbers += 1
print(evenNumbers,oddNumbers)
#9. Create a variable that asks the user for an integer and an empty integer variable.
asky=int(input("give me a number:"))
mt=1
#10. Create a loop with a range from 1 to the number the user input. Use the loop to find the
#factorial of that number and print the result. A factorial of a number is that number multiplied
#by every number before it until you reach 1. (For example: 5! is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120)
for o in range(1,asky+1):
    mt *= o
print(mt)
import time
thing='neck hurt'
for d in range(1000):
    time.sleep(0.1)
    print(thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,thing,)
